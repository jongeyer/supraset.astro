# Hi! My name is Jon 👋🏻

I am an engineering leader focused on UI/UX and developer experience for data-rich platforms. My expertise is in leading teams to build performant applications for data management, visualization, and analysis.

In my early academic interests I focused on physics and astrophysics, but I also immersed myself in sculpture and later in pottery. I was not satisfied choosing sides between these worlds, but instead I needed to explore areas where these domains intersect. I found it in an MFA program in Design & Technology -- a perfect overlay of the creative and the technical; expression and purpose; abstraction and usability; intuition and reason. (This dichotomy may be a silly simplification... but it's made sense to me.)

After many years honing my skills, I have found that my inspiration and perspiration is best applied to building experiences for data-rich platforms. In this space I aim to empower people to overcome the complex and the mundane through engagement.
