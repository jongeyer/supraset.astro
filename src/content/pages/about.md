# Hi! My name is Jon 👋🏻

I am a front-end engineer leading teams to build performant, data-rich web applications. My expertise centers on UI/UX for effective and engaging data management, presentation, visualization, and analysis. From big to smal

While my early academic interests focused on physics and astrophysics, I also immersed myself in sculpture and later in pottery. I got an MFA in Design & Technology which was a perfect overlay of the creative and the technical; expression and purpose; abstraction and usability; intuition and reason.

These domains intersect in many contexts, but I have been most drawn to UI/UX, data presentation, and data visualization. But I am fortunate to have found inspiration all around me while working on all kinds of things.

After several years honing my skills, I have found that my inspiration and perspiration is best applied to biolding experiences on the web.
