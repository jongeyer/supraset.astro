# Hi! My name is Jon

I am an engineering leader focused on UI/UX and developer experience for data-rich platforms. My expertise is in leading teams to build performant applications for data management, visualization, and analysis.

In my early academic interests at the University of Chicago, I focused on physics and astrophysics, but I also immersed myself in sculpture and later in pottery. I was not satisfied choosing sides between these worlds, but instead I needed to explore areas where these domains intersect. I found it in an MFA program in Design & Technology at Parsons School of Design -- a perfect overlay of the creative and the technical; expression and purpose; abstraction and usability; intuition and reason.

So my work now is centered on creating experiences that help people make sense of complex information. With all the data-saturation we face, I believe this is more important than ever.
