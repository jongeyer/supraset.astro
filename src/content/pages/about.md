# Hi! My name is Jon

I lead teams to build user experiences for data-rich platforms. Iâ€™ve worked in different industries -- from e-commerce to educational technology to working for a data team at NOAA. My expertise is in leading teams to build performant applications for data management, visualization, and analysis.

In my early academic interests at the University of Chicago, I focused on physics and astrophysics, but you could also find me in the sculpture studio and experimenting with digital designs with Photoshop. I wasn't satisfied choosing sides between these worlds. I needed to explore areas where these domains intersect. I found it in an MFA program in Design & Technology at Parsons School of Design -- a perfect overlay of the creative and the technical; expression and purpose; abstraction and usability; intuition and reason.

Work now is centered on creating experiences that help people make sense of complex information. With all the data-saturation we face, I believe this is more important than ever.
